The main component of this Non Contact Thermometer is a MLX90614 Non contact temperature sensor. 
The output from this sensor is connected to Arduino Nano. 
Arduino print the temperature on smart phone with the help of Serial Monitor Android App. 
So no need of external power pack. Because Arduino and sensor will take power from smart phone.
